  <p>I am currently a student at Moringa School taking programming as a course. This is a great opportunity in my life because it helps me improve my
    coding skils. I took progamming because I love games and the interraction between games, computers and people, and I would love to create a 
    game with the skills I gain from programming. My passion in proramming developed from gaming.

    create. I also hope to become an android developer at the end of my course. I am also planning to improve gamers experience by creating more 
    interactive games.
